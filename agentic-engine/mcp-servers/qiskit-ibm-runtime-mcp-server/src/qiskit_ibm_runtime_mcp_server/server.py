This server provides access to IBM Quantum hardware through Qiskit IBM Runtime.

Getting started:
1. Call setup_ibm_quantum_account_tool to authenticate (or it will attempt \
to use QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN env var or saved credentials automatically).
2. Use list_backends_tool to see available backends, or least_busy_backend_tool \
to quickly find one with a short queue.

Running circuits:
1. Use run_sampler_tool for measurement sampling (bitstring counts) or \
run_estimator_tool for expectation value estimation.
2. Jobs are ASYNCHRONOUS. After submitting, use get_job_status_tool to poll \
until the job completes, then get_job_results_tool to retrieve results.
3. Browse circuits:// resources (bell-state, ghz-state, random, superposition) \
for ready-to-run example circuits.

Backend analysis:
- Use get_backend_properties_tool for static info (processor type, basis gates, \
qubit count).
- Use get_backend_calibration_tool for live calibration data (T1, T2, gate \
errors, faulty qubits).
- Use find_optimal_qubit_chains_tool or find_optimal_qv_qubits_tool to select \
the highest-fidelity qubits for your experiment.

Account management:
- Use available_instances_tool to see accessible instances and usage_info_tool \
to check quota and consumption.\

                - OpenQASM 2.0 string (legacy, auto-detected)
                - Base64-encoded QPY binary (for tool chaining with transpiler output)
                Must include measurement operations to produce results.
        backend_name: Name of the IBM Quantum backend (e.g., 'ibm_brisbane').
                     If not provided, uses the least busy operational backend.
        shots: Number of measurement shots (repetitions). Default is 4096.
               Higher values give more statistical accuracy.
        circuit_format: Format of the circuit input. Options:
                       - "auto" (default): Automatically detect format
                       - "qasm3": OpenQASM 3.0/2.0 text format
                       - "qpy": Base64-encoded QPY binary format
        dynamical_decoupling: Enable dynamical decoupling to suppress decoherence
                             during idle periods. Default is True (recommended).
        dd_sequence: Dynamical decoupling pulse sequence. Options:
                    - "XX": Basic X-X sequence
                    - "XpXm": X+/X- sequence
                    - "XY4": 4-pulse XY sequence (default, most robust)
        twirling: Enable Pauli twirling on 2-qubit gates to convert coherent
                 errors into stochastic noise. Default is True (recommended).
        measure_twirling: Enable twirling on measurements for readout error
                         mitigation. Default is True (recommended).

    Returns:
        Job submission status including:
        - job_id: Use with get_job_status_tool to check completion
        - backend: The backend where the circuit will run
        - shots: Number of shots requested
        - error_mitigation: Summary of enabled techniques

    Note:
        Jobs run asynchronously. Use get_job_status_tool to monitor progress.
        Results contain measurement bitstrings and their occurrence counts.
