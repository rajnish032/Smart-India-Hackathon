This server provides local Qiskit quantum computing capabilities for circuit \
analysis, transpilation, and format conversion.

Recommended workflow:
1. Load circuits with load_circuit_from_qasm_tool (accepts both QASM 2.0 and \
3.0). This validates the circuit and returns metadata (qubit count, depth, \
gate counts).
2. Use analyze_circuit_tool to understand circuit complexity before deciding \
on a transpilation strategy.
3. Transpile with transpile_circuit_tool. Optimization level 2 is recommended \
for most circuits. Avoid level 3 for large circuits (100+ qubits or 1000+ \
gates) as it can be very slow.
4. Use compare_optimization_levels_tool to see trade-offs across all levels \
when unsure which optimization level to use.

Format conversion:
- convert_qpy_to_qasm3_tool: Convert binary QPY output to human-readable QASM3
- convert_qasm3_to_qpy_tool: Convert QASM to QPY for full circuit fidelity
- export_circuit_to_qasm_tool: Export QPY circuits to QASM 2.0 or 3.0

Browse qiskit://transpiler/ resources for available basis gate presets \
(ibm_eagle, ibm_heron, ion_trap, etc.) and coupling map topologies \
(linear, ring, grid, full).\

            - 2: Medium optimization (noise-adaptive layout) [default, recommended]
            - 3: Heavy optimization (best results, can be very slow for large circuits)
