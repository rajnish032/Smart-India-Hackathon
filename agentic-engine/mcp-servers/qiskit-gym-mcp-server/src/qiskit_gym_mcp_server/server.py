"""Qiskit Gym MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol server that provides reinforcement learning-based
quantum circuit synthesis capabilities using qiskit-gym.

Features:
- Create RL environments for permutation, linear function, and Clifford synthesis
- Train models using PPO or AlphaZero algorithms
- Extract subtopologies from IBM Quantum hardware (Heron, Nighthawk)
- Synthesize optimal quantum circuits using trained models
- Save, load, and manage trained models
- TensorBoard integration for training visualization

This module serves as the entry point. Tools and resources are defined in
separate modules for maintainability:
- server_tools.py: All @mcp.tool() definitions
- server_resources.py: All @mcp.resource() definitions
- app.py: The shared FastMCP instance
