"""Utility functions for the IBM Runtime MCP server.

This module provides the `with_sync` decorator for creating dual async/sync APIs.

Synchronous Execution
---------------------
All async functions decorated with `@with_sync` can be called synchronously
via the `.sync` attribute:

    from qiskit_ibm_runtime_mcp_server.ibm_runtime import list_backends

    # Async usage (in async context)
    result = await list_backends()

    # Sync usage (in sync context, Jupyter notebooks, DSPy, etc.)
    result = list_backends.sync()

The sync wrapper handles event loop management automatically, including
nested event loops in Jupyter notebooks (via nest_asyncio).
